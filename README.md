# Colloquium_IMPA_2015
My presentation at the 30th Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium at the National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA).
If you speak Portuguese, you may want to look at the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcXjh0CdkLA) of the talk, which fortunately includes mostly the slides, with only a brief appearance of my (not!) beautiful self.

I am specially grateful to my fellow mathematicians [Erick Matsen](https://github.com/matsen), [Mike Steel](http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~m.steel/) and [Felipe Figueiredo](https://github.com/philsf) for insights and proof-reading.

Here are some links I found extremely useful when preparing this talk:
